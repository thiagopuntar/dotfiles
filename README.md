# Puntar Dotfiles

Another dotfiles repo to centralize all the config files in a single place and make it easier to move it to another computer.

For now, my setup includes:

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as a terminal emulator;
- [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as a zsh framework;
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) as a terminal multiplexer and helps me managing windows and panes;
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as a code editor;

## Neovim config

My config for neovim editor was extremely inspired (to not say totally copied ðŸ˜…) by [The Primeagen's setup](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=MZnSUGCVOdmvv3hF) and [Josean's](https://youtu.be/vdn_pKJUda8?si=kq5_91qoim-P4lbG).
